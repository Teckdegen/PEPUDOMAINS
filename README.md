The Pepu Domains contract is designed to work seamlessly with modern frontend frameworks. This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to build production-ready web applications that interact with the Pepu Domains service.

### **Frontend Architecture Overview**

When building a frontend for Pepu Domains, you'll need to consider several key architectural components that work together to create a seamless user experience:

**1. Wallet Connection Layer**
The frontend must establish secure connections to user wallets. This involves implementing wallet connectors for popular providers like MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, or other Web3 wallets. The wallet connection is essential for domain registration, renewal, and management operations that require user signatures. This layer should handle wallet switching, account changes, and network validation.

**2. Contract Interaction Layer**
This layer handles all direct communication with the smart contract. It includes functions for reading domain data (resolution, availability checks) and writing operations (registration, renewal, wallet updates). The contract interaction layer should implement proper error handling, transaction status monitoring, and gas estimation. This layer should also handle contract events and provide real-time updates.

**3. State Management**
Frontend applications need robust state management to handle domain data, user wallet states, transaction statuses, and UI states. This ensures a smooth user experience with real-time updates and proper loading states. Consider using state management libraries like Redux, Zustand, or React Context API depending on your application complexity.

**4. User Interface Components**
The UI should provide intuitive interfaces for domain search, registration forms, domain management dashboards, and transaction monitoring. Each component should handle different states like loading, success, error, and pending transactions. The interface should be responsive and accessible across all devices.

### **Key Frontend Features to Implement**

**Domain Search and Resolution**
Implement a search interface that allows users to check domain availability and resolve existing domains to wallet addresses. This should include real-time validation, instant feedback on domain status, and suggestions for similar available domains. The search should be fast and provide immediate results as users type.

**Domain Registration Flow**
Create a comprehensive registration process that guides users through domain selection, duration choice, fee calculation, and payment confirmation. The flow should include proper validation, error handling, transaction monitoring, and success confirmation. Consider implementing a multi-step wizard for complex registration processes.

**Domain Management Dashboard**
Build a user dashboard where domain owners can view their registered domains, check expiration dates, renew domains, and update wallet addresses. This should include bulk operations for users with multiple domains, filtering and sorting capabilities, and export functionality for domain lists.

**Transaction Monitoring**
Implement real-time transaction tracking that shows users the status of their domain operations. This includes pending transactions, confirmation status, success/error notifications, and transaction history. Provide clear feedback about gas costs and confirmation times.

**Admin Interface**
If building for administrators, create interfaces for managing fees, adding/removing TLDs, and performing administrative operations. This requires proper access control, security measures, and audit trails for all administrative actions.

### **User Experience Considerations**
